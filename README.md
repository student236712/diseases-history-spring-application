# diseases-history-spring-application
Final engineering project
It is an spring boot based application used for tracking and analyzing patient's diseases history. 
History is created basing on:
-diseases
-hospital treatment
-medical procedures
-medicaments  with doses.
For better diseases and procedures searching and presentation there were introduced shortcuts, codes recommended by WHO.
Due this diseases could be filtered by category, group and classification.

Both whole history as filtered can be shown at browser page. Every event is sortable by start date, end date, name, codes 
and its content. 

If there are procedures results in nummerical form there is possibility to show their values due time on the graph.
